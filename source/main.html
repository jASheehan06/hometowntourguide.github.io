        <p>Hello, here I will give you an introduction of my hometown of Clonroche, its history, its landmarks and some people.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h1>History of Clonroche</h1>
        <br>
        <p>First I will discuss the history of the town.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The earliest record of the town can be traced back to 1588 when it had the name of "Clone roche"</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nothing is really known of what happens around that time period before the arrival of the Carew family, but a pub named the Cloch Bán first opened its doors around the 1650's.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not know what happened in that century besides the founding of that pub.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We now go to the 1700's where Castleboro house is built in 1770 and resided by the Carew family.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The family convert what was already there, into a village on their estate for their workers to reside.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, from 1770-1923 the manor reigned and stood tall until it was burned down during the War of Independance by IRA supporters in the town. Its ruins stands still of an old era for the village, with most of the estate converted to farmland.</p>
